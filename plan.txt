Per the instructions on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors#assignment

Randomly decide the "computer's" hand (rock,paper,scissors) using the random number generator for 3 different integers.
Set a string based on the integer value.

Take an answer from the player in text. Use the all caps or all lowercase function to ensure that it is case-insensitive

Create a function to compare the player and computer values to determine the winner. 
Compare with if statements or similar and consider ties.

Create a loop to run through a best of 5 rounds. Track Computer and Player wins and stop once either reaches 3 points.
Ties should extend the rounds by not adding any score as neither has won.
